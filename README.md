# Demo StarterKit for Twig

The Demo StarterKit for Twig is meant to be used as a demo that highlights how to combine Twig and Pattern Lab. It is currently very thin. 

## Requirements

The Demo StarterKit for Twig requires the following PatternEngine:

* `pattern-lab/patternengine-twig`: [documentation](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternengine-php-twig#twig-patternengine-for-pattern-lab), [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternengine-php-twig), [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/pattern-lab/patternengine-twig)

## Install

This StarterKit can be installed using the following command:

    php core/console --starterkit --install newcity/starterkit-twig-demo

It is recommended that you **do not** install this StarterKit as a dependency for your Pattern Lab project via Composer.

## Edit Files

After installation the files for this StarterKit can be found in `source/`.
